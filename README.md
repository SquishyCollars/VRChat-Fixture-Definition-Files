# VRChat Fixture Profiles /Definition Files
A repo for sharing fixture profiles for fixtures that get used around VRChat, for as many softwares as possible

Getting into VRChat lighting design, one common thread I've seen around is that fixture profiles can often be hard to find, especially since there is a wide range of software used by LDs.
Im hoping to help remedy that with this repo!

# Help out!
Im taking suggestions for how to best organize this repo, and I would *love* if you have fixture profiles to share 💖
Feel free to add any software you're using as well, to help others.





If I have added a profile I found here, and you're the author and you'd rather not have it in here, let me know and I will remove.

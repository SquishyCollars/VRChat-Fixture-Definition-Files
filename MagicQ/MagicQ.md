# MagicQ Fixture Files
Files by Evder, documentation by Kuropper

- Place the .hed files in Documents\MagicQ\show\heads
- In MagicQ, click PATCH (or PTCH depending on layout)
- Click CHOOSE HEAD
- Scroll down to VRSL and click the head you want to patch
- Click PATCH IT
- Enter the number of fixtures you want to patch, along with the universe and channel to place the first fixture (howmany@universe-channel)

These profiles come with an extended color palette that is automatically added to your showfile.
Keep in mind that the gobos included in the fixture files are for out-of-the-box VRSL.
Depending on the rig, the gobo names and sprites may be incorrect. In this case, the buttons will still work fine, and they can be renamed if needed.

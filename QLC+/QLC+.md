Saving your fixture definitions
To use your fixture definitions in QLC+, you must save them in a location where QLC+ expects to find them. There are two places where you can save your fixture definitions:

1.~~In the same folder as your QLC+ workspace (Handy if you want to give your workspace to someone else)~~ (Use Step 2 if a beginner)
2. In the user fixtures folder found in the following locations:
Linux: it is a hidden folder in your user home directory: $HOME/.qlcplus/Fixtures
Windows: it is a folder in your user directory: C:\\Users\{Username}\QLC+\Fixtures
Mac OS: it is located in your user Library directory: $HOME/Library/Application\\ Support/QLC+/Fixtures
Important note: you SHOULD NOT save or copy your custom fixtures into the QLC+ system fixtures folder. This is because when QLC+ is uninstalled, all the fixtures in this folder are deleted. It can also cause unintended conflicts between the system and your own fixture definitions.
